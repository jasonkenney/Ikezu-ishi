# Creating Your Character
{: .no_toc }

*A man is a castle, a man is a stone wall, a man is a moat, mercy is your friend, revenge is your enemy.* - Takeda Shingen

## Roll Attributes

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

### Strength (STR) / 筋力 (Kinryoku – Strength)
{: .no_toc }

> Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### Dexterity (DEX) / 敏捷力 (Binshouryoku - Agility)
{: .no_toc }

> Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### Willpower (WIL) / 気合 (Kiai – Fighting Spirit)
{: .no_toc }

> Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's attributes, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

>**Roll Under System**: When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate attribute. If they roll **equal to or under** that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

>**Attributes** are not universal descriptors. A PC with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

## Roll Hit Protection (HP)

Roll 1d6 to determine PC's starting Hit Protection (**HP**), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

>**Remember:** HP stands for “hit protection,” reflecting a PC’s ability to avoid damage through speed, guile, strength, or other non-armor means.

HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long.

A PC’s base HP can be increased by **Wounds** and gameplay but can never be higher than 3d6.

## Choose a Background

Players may choose or roll d20 against the **Background Table** to determine part of the PC’s past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to PCs. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

## Backgrounds

| D20 | BACKGROUND          | D20 | BACKGROUND                   |
|:----|:--------------------|:----|:-----------------------------|
| 1   | Bandit (Sanzoku)    | 11  | Miner (Kofu)                 |
| 2   | Blacksmith (Kaji)   | 12  | Mountain Ascetic (Yamabushi) |
| 3   | Carpenter (Daiku)   | 13  | Ninja (Shinobi)              |
| 4   | Cleric (Souryo)     | 14  | Performer (Geinoujin)        |
| 5   | Gambler (Tobakushi) | 15  | Pirate (Kaizoku)             |
| 6   | Farmer (Hyakushou)  | 16  | Ronin (Ronin)                |

| 10  | Merchant (Gyousha)  | 20  | Tea Master (Chajin)          |


## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with 6 slots and Starting Gear listed for their **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select gear from the **Equipment Table**.

## Inventory

PCs have a total of 10 inventory slots:

- six slots in a kate-bukuro

- one slot for each hand

- two slots for their upper body

Inventory is abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide's discretion.

Anyone with a full inventory (filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts, horses, mules, or other equipment can increase inventory. **Retainers** can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Inventory Slots

- Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.

- **Petty** items do not take up any slots and can be bundled together.

- **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

- A bag of coins worth less than 100 ryo is petty and does not occupy a slot.


## Finishing Touches

Roll PC’s **Age** (2d20+10).

Players may fill out the rest of their character sheets using the following tables.

>Upon reaching adulthood, children would receive a **call name (*azana*)** to be used instead of their given name.
>
>*Genpuku* is a coming-of-age ceremony which originated during the 8th century. The ceremony marked the transition from childhood to adulthood around the age of 11-15. Often involving a sponsor of higher rank, this ceremony included the exchanging of a childhood name for an adult name (*eboshi-na*) as well as a courtesy name (azana), the adoption of adult clothing, and assumption of adult responsibilities.
>
>An azana would typically be used instead of one's given adult name for everyday use. It was believed that knowing someone's real name could grant power over them. A real name was typically used only in interactions with the emperor, official acts and appointments, or in death.
