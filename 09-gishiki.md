## Using Magic in Ikezu-ishi

The Ikezu-Ishi magic system is inspired by and derived from some aspects
of magic and mysticism in Japanese history. Effort was made to create
something that fit the flavor of the setting without lifting and
reshaping historical and current belief systems in ways that are not
true to form.

Magic in Ikezu-ishi requires the PC to create a Rite Card through study
and discipline. These objects represent the time, focus, and energy put
into the study of its use and effect and can only be used by the person
who created them.

- Anyone may use their downtime to create a Rite Card according to the
  rules below.

- A Rite Card counts as a Petty item and take up no inventory slots.

- Most effects are subtle and interpretive and may appear to work merely
  because the practitioner believes.

Unless stated otherwise, any remaining effect of a Rite Card ends when
the PC or target rests for a watch and does not carry over.

*For example, if the PC uses Heaven's Reflection and rolled 4 Focus
Dice, they'd be allowed to ask 4 questions. If they only ask two before
resting for the night, the remaining two are forfeit.*
