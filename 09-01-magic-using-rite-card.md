##  Using a Rite Card

PCs must have spent time to craft the Rite Card in their possession and
must have a calm moment to use it.

- The PC must conduct the **To Use** action of their Rite Card.

- Rites that say "Target" mean the PC can choose another PC or NPC to
  either assist with the Rite or to gain the Rite's effect.

- Players have an amount of d6 Focus Dice (**FD**) equal to the amount
  of available inventory slots. They choose how many they wish to invest
  (up to a maximum of 4). Rites will refer to these as \[**DICE**\].
  Some rites refer to their \[**SUM**\] as well.

- Roll \[**DICE**\]. For each die that shows 4-6, PC gains one Fatigue.

- Each **FD** rolled still counts toward the effect's \[**DICE**\]
  count, even if it causes fatigue.

- If any doubles are rolled, the rite has a **Feedback Effect** (see
  table on page 3).

- If successful, apply the Rite's Effect.

- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to
  \[SUM\]Ã—10 minutes and have a range of up to 40 feet.

- Reduce the Rite Card's remaining charges by 1. When a Rite Card
  reaches 0 uses, it crumbles, fades, or burns away.
