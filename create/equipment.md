{:toc}

The following weapons, armor, and equipment are not an exhaustive list of items that may be available in a feudal Japan inspired setting. Players and Guides may use and stat additional items as needed.

## Weapon Types

Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**:

- **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.

- **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

- **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)

Weapons take up **1 inventory slot** unless marked as **Bulky**. Bulky weapons also require two hands to wield.

## Weapon Skills

- **Counter X:** Damage rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.

- **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of Armor, but Damage rolls of X or lower completely miss.

- **Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.

- **Sweep X**: Damage rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in Melee range. You can’t chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.

- **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.


## Learning How To Use A Weapon

Weapons require **Training** and experience to be used effectively.


### Damage Type Proficiency

To use a weapon’s ***Damage Type*** effects, such as *bludgeoning, piercing,* or *slashing*, players need:

- **Training** with *any weapon of that type* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.


### Weapon Skill Proficiency

To use the ***Weapon Skill*** effects, such as *heavy*, *sweep*, etc, of an individual weapon, players need:

- **Training** with *that specific weapon* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

When picking up a different weapon with the same Skill tag (i.e., a Longsword and Scimitar both have **Sweep**), you’ll still need to gain Weapon Skill Proficiency.

## Equipment Rarity

The availability of equipment can vary between towns and regions. Larger settlements have a more varied selection than smaller. The Guide may use **Rarity** to determine equipment available based on the size of the settlement (see **Settlement Size** on page [39](ch007.xhtml#light-sources)) or may determine item availability based on the attributes of the location.

| \# | RARITY | AVAILABILITY |

| **1** | Common | Regularly available items that can be found in any settlement of 100 people (town) or more. |
| **2** | Uncommon | Regionally specific items that can be found in settlements of 1000 people (Market Town) or more. |
| **3** | Rare | Specialized or more expensive items that can be found in settlements of 5,000 people (Castle Town) or more. |
| **4** | Exclusive | Items with a very specific purpose or requiring expert craftsman, found in settlements of 10,000+ people (City) or specific schools |
