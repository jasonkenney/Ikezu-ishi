# Gishiki


Gishiki is based on "Glog Magic Hack for Cairn" (https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/glog-magic)


## Using Magic in Ikezu-ishi

The Ikezu-Ishi magic system is inspired by and derived from some aspects
of magic and mysticism in Japanese history. Effort was made to create
something that fit the flavor of the setting without lifting and
reshaping historical and current belief systems in ways that are not
true to form.

Magic in Ikezu-ishi requires the PC to create a Rite Card through study
and discipline. These objects represent the time, focus, and energy put
into the study of its use and effect and can only be used by the person
who created them.

- Anyone may use their downtime to create a Rite Card according to the
  rules below.

- A Rite Card counts as a Petty item and take up no inventory slots.

- Most effects are subtle and interpretive and may appear to work merely
  because the practitioner believes.

Unless stated otherwise, any remaining effect of a Rite Card ends when
the PC or target rests for a watch and does not carry over.

*For example, if the PC uses Heaven's Reflection and rolled 4 Focus
Dice, they'd be allowed to ask 4 questions. If they only ask two before
resting for the night, the remaining two are forfeit.*

##  Using a Rite {#using-a-rite}

PCs must have spent time to craft the Rite Card in their possession and
must have a calm moment to use it.

- The PC must conduct the **To Use** action of their Rite Card.

- Rites that say "Target" mean the PC can choose another PC or NPC to
  either assist with the Rite or to gain the Rite's effect.

- Players have an amount of d6 Focus Dice (**FD**) equal to the amount
  of available inventory slots. They choose how many they wish to invest
  (up to a maximum of 4). Rites will refer to these as \[**DICE**\].
  Some rites refer to their \[**SUM**\] as well.

- Roll \[**DICE**\]. For each die that shows 4-6, PC gains one Fatigue.

- Each **FD** rolled still counts toward the effect's \[**DICE**\]
  count, even if it causes fatigue.

- If any doubles are rolled, the rite has a **Feedback Effect** (see
  table on page 3).

- If successful, apply the Rite's Effect.

- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to
  \[SUM\]×10 minutes and have a range of up to 40 feet.

- Reduce the Rite Card's remaining charges by 1. When a Rite Card
  reaches 0 uses, it crumbles, fades, or burns away.

### Feedback Effect Table

| SUM       | EFFECT                                                                                                      |

| **4**     | Double the impact of the rite.                                                                              |
| **5-6**   | The rite fails.                                                                                             |

| **11**    | You take 1d4 WIL damage when using rites for the next 24 hours.                                             |
| **12-13** | You cannot use rites for 1d6 hours, and any attempts to manipulate rites will fail.                         |

| **16**    | There is a chain reaction to the spell (the Guide will say how). Take an additional Fatigue.                |
| **17**    | The rite's effects are reversed. The Guide will tell you how. Take an additional Fatigue.                   |

| **19**    | The rite fails and the PC is unable to ever craft that rite again.                                          |

| **23**    | The rite's effect is permanent.                                                                             |
| **24**    | The rite drastically backfires, killing the PC instantly.                                                   |

## Learning a Rite

Learning a Rite requires finding a trainer for a specific Rite at a
specific location -- finding a school that specifically teaches
naginatajutsu (fighting with a naginata) -- or with an individual --
finding a thief to teach how to pick a lock.

- Players must say which Rite they are attempting to study and find a
  source in game to learn the rite.

- Some Rites require previous knowledge of another Rite to learn. The PC
  must have successfully learned this Rite in the past, but does not
  have to have the Rite in their possession to study the new one.

- Hiring a trainer will cost 10 ryo per day (or other incentives other
  than ryo).

- PCs must spend at least 7 days of downtime in training or pilgrimage.

- Players must say how long their PC is training for and pay the Ryo
  cost before rolling for a success.

- For each day beyond the first seven the player gains a +1 to their WIL
  save to learn the ritual.

- PC's must take the time to craft a Rite Card, even if they've
  previously studied the Rite. If a PC is studying a Rite they
  successfully studied previously, they gain +1 to their WIL save for
  this study.

- Roll a WIL Save at the end of the training.

- Success: You learn the Rite.

- Failure: You need more time (re-roll after another week or with help).

- A 20 is always an automatic failure.

- PC creates a Rite Card for the learned ritual.

## Rite Card

A Rite Card is a slip of paper that a PC has created through deep study
and discipline.

For players, the Rite Card contains information about the rite and how
many uses it has remaining before it must be discarded and is destroyed
in game.

Each Rite Card should contain the following information:

- Rite Name:

- Uses:

- Effect Summary:

- Drawbacks / Fatigue / WIL Cost:

- Notes / Date of Creation:

Players can physically check off uses. Once all uses are filled, the
paper is torn or burned in play.

## Rites

- \[DICE\] are equal to Focus Dice invested in the spell.

- \[SUM\] is a number equal to the sum of rolled Focus Dice.

- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to
  \[SUM\]×10 minutes and have a range of up to 40 feet.
