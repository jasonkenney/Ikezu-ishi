## Learning a Rite

Learning a Rite requires finding a trainer for a specific Rite at a
specific location -- finding a school that specifically teaches
naginatajutsu (fighting with a naginata) -- or with an individual --
finding a thief to teach how to pick a lock.

- Players must say which Rite they are attempting to study and find a
  source in game to learn the rite.

- Some Rites require previous knowledge of another Rite to learn. The PC
  must have successfully learned this Rite in the past, but does not
  have to have the Rite in their possession to study the new one.

- Hiring a trainer will cost 10 ryo per day (or other incentives other
  than ryo).

- PCs must spend at least 7 days of downtime in training or pilgrimage.

- Players must say how long their PC is training for and pay the Ryo
  cost before rolling for a success.

- For each day beyond the first seven the player gains a +1 to their WIL
  save to learn the ritual.

- PC's must take the time to craft a Rite Card, even if they've
  previously studied the Rite. If a PC is studying a Rite they
  successfully studied previously, they gain +1 to their WIL save for
  this study.

- Roll a WIL Save at the end of the training.

- Success: You learn the Rite.

- Failure: You need more time (re-roll after another week or with help).

- A 20 is always an automatic failure.

- PC creates a Rite Card for the learned ritual.
