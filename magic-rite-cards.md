## Rite Cards

A Rite Card is a slip of paper that a PC has created through deep study
and discipline.

For players, the Rite Card contains information about the rite and how
many uses it has remaining before it must be discarded and is destroyed
in game.

Each Rite Card should contain the following information:

- Rite Name:

- Uses:

- Effect Summary:

- Drawbacks / Fatigue / WIL Cost:

- Notes / Date of Creation:

Players can physically check off uses. Once all uses are filled, the
paper is torn or burned in play.
